# **Intro:**

Did you know that over 3.3 Million Australians currently live in poverty including 700,000 children. According to studies conducted by the Australian government, it has been identified that over 40% of Australians who rent will most likely not be able to pay rent for the next 3 months. Good morning to all those present here today at the Parliament House in Canberra, I would like to thank you for putting some time out to hear what I have to say as a citizen of Australia. My name is Joe, working as a parking enforcement officer in Port Phillip, Victoria. My job earns me an average salary which barely allows me to put food on the table which is what I would like to address to you all today, the cost of living crisis.

Many people have the dream of getting out of their rental property and own their own, as it gives them the freedom they and the experience. However, with the current crisis, 3/4 of first-home buyers do not even have 20% deposit for a home loan which has been requiring them to either pay for Lenders Mortgage Insurance also known as LMI or sourcing funds from their family members such as their parents. According to the Helia Insurance Study interviewing over 1000s first-home buyers that took place in July 2024 found that nearly 90% of them agreed stating that it was near to impossible for them to purchase a first-home. Over 55% of the interviewed buyers currently take up LMI, which is an increase from the 2023 study that took place which found only 36% of them use LMI as they cannot afford the 20% deposit requirement. 48% of the buyers found that government assistant schemes that have been put in place have allowed them to get their first home. However, 84% of the research study participants stated that their first home is not their ‘dream’ or ‘ideal’ property. Therefore, even though there are government assistant schemes available for first-home buyers, many still do not get their dream first home as they are spending greater than 50% of their take-home income on paying off their mortgage.
